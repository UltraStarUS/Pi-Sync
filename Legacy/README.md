# Legacy Code Folder
## What is this?
I don't want my old work to go unknown or unnoticed - Ajaxx. 

These folders hold backup files and configurations from the Pi Server, in the event that you have to go backwards 

then just use these folders, otherwise you should continue to use the newest verion outside of these folders. 

## Reasonings?
The folder Pi-Sync_PRIOR, holds code from the time where we had to use the Pi server as the center of the Syncing universe. 

We have it set up now to allow for the pis to communicate with the server to get synced however, before that we had the pi server sync to the
pis. Lots of unnecessary work went into that, which was simplified with the new version of the Pi.
