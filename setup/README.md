# Setup Folder
## Purpose
This holds all of the data required for getting a pi server from bonestock ubuntu server, to Pi Server
## Issues
If any networking settings change or need to be changed in the future, look through the files in this folder as they have multiple hardcoded 

instances of static IP addresses and DNS Servers.
